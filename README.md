# Iterated-Function-Systems
A program for visualizing fractals generated by IFSs in browser, written using the p5.js library.

Note that, as of right now, there is no UI, so the program must be interacted with via a javascript console. A 2x2 matrix object prototype is included to allow the user to create simple 2D linear functions to be included in the IFS. These functions can be easily transformed from simple linear functions to affine functions through vector addition.
